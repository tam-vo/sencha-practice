Installing Sencha Touch
-----------------------

[Download the Sencha Touch SDK][sdk], and unzip the archive. Assuming that you've saved the SDK into your downloads folder (`~/Downloads/sencha-touch-2-b3`), you can run the following commands in the terminal:

    cd path/to/Sencha-Touch-Boilerplate
    cp -R ~/Downloads/sencha-touch-2-b3/{*.js,src,resources} touch/

This copies only the parts that we need from the Sencha Touch SDK into the `touch/` directory.
